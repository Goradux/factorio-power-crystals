# Factorio Power Crystals

This mod adds "power crystals" to the game. Power crystals work like beacons, but they are naturally generated and more powerful.

There are 4 types of power crystals:

* Red (productivity)
* Blue (speed)
* Green (power consumption, pollution)
* Purple (negative speed, negative power consumption, negative pollution)

Each of these types (except the purple one) can be of three sizes and signal strengths. The purple crystal can only be tier 1 and 2.

## Why?

The main idea is to encourage more map interaction for the player. Normally players just build their bases wherever they want. This mod will try to push players towards choosing where to build the base more carefully.

## Compatibility

The mod does not make any drastic gameplay changes, so it should be compatible with everything.

## Mod Settings

You can toggle automatic map tagging of newly discovered crystals. The default value is off. The crystals are color-coded on the minimap, and since there are so many, I recommend keeping it off.
