power-crystals-tag-new-crystals=Tag new crystals
power-crystals-enable-negative=Enable negative crystals

[mod-setting-description]
power-crystals-tag-new-crystals=Adds map tags to each newly discovered crystal location.
power-crystals-enable-negative=Enable generation of purple crystals that have negative effects - increased energy consumption and increased pollution. If enabled/disabled mid game, newly discovered chunks will/won't contain negative purple crystals.
