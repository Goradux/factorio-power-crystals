power-crystals-tag-new-crystals=Tag new crystals
power-crystals-enable-negative=Enable negative crystals

[mod-setting-description]
power-crystals-tag-new-crystals=Adds map tags to each newly discovered crystal location.
power-crystals-enable-negative=Enable generation of purple crystals that have negative effects - increased energy consumption and increased pollution. If enabled/disabled mid game, newly discovered chunks will/won't contain negative purple crystals.
power-crystals-frequency-tier-1=100 is equal to 1%. The chance of spawning a crystal of tier 1 in each generated chunk. The default values aim to cover 37% of the map in red/green/blue crystals and 21% of purple crystals. The crystals may overlap. Tier 1 default value covers ~9% of the map area in tier 1 crystals.
power-crystals-frequency-tier-2=100 is equal to 1%. The chance of spawning a crystal of tier 2 in each generated chunk. The default values aim to cover 37% of the map in red/green/blue crystals and 21% of purple crystals. The crystals may overlap. Tier 2 default value covers ~13% of the map area in tier 2 crystals.
power-crystals-frequency-tier-3=100 is equal to 1%. The chance of spawning a crystal of tier 3 in each generated chunk. The default values aim to cover 37% of the map in red/green/blue crystals and 21% of purple crystals. The crystals may overlap. Tier 3 default value covers ~16% of the map area in tier 3 crystals.
